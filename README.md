# Gists for Wallpaper Maker

---

## About

This is simply a list of gists to be made available for use on [FreeWallpaperMaker.com](https://freewallpapermaker.com/).

My reasons for creating _Free Wallpaper Maker_ are:

1. To make it a bit easier to create custom wallpapers that are more functional than the the standard generic picture
2. I wanted something to use gists for
3. I was looking for something to try out Nuxt 3 on

This collection is presented in the form of a Github repo to make it easier for anyone to suggest changes or contribute their own gists.
